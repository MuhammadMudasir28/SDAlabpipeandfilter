Overview

This Java program demonstrates the Pipe and Filter design pattern using Java's functional programming capabilities. It processes a list of integers through a pipeline of filters, each performing a specific transformation or filtering operation.

How It Works

A list of integers (input) is defined.

A pipeline (filters) is created, consisting of multiple filtering functions.

The input is passed through each filter sequentially using the processPipeline method.

The final processed list is printed as output.

Code Explanation

1. Main Method (main)

Initializes an integer list (input) from 1 to 10.

Creates a list of filtering functions (filters).

Filters include:

filterEvenNumbers: Keeps only even numbers.

squareNumbers: Squares each number.

filterNumbersGreaterThanTen: Keeps numbers greater than 10.

filterOddNumbers: Keeps only odd numbers.

Passes input through the processPipeline function.

Prints the final result.

2. Pipeline Processing (processPipeline)

Iterates through each filter function and applies it to the input list.

The list is updated at each step, refining the data progressively.

3. Filter Functions

filterEvenNumbers: Selects even numbers using a stream filter.

squareNumbers: Squares each number using a stream map operation.

filterNumbersGreaterThanTen: Retains numbers greater than 10.

filterOddNumbers: Selects only odd numbers (newly added filter).

Potential Issues

The last filter (filterOddNumbers) contradicts filterEvenNumbers, potentially leading to an empty list.

The order of filters affects the output.

Sample Output

Depending on filter order, the output could vary. With the current order, it is likely to return an empty list due to conflicting filters.

How to Run

Copy the code into a .java file (e.g., PipeAndFilter.java).

Compile using:

javac PipeAndFilter.java

Run the program:

java PipeAndFilter

Conclusion

This implementation showcases how the Pipe and Filter pattern can be used for sequential data transformation and filtering in Java using functional programming.
